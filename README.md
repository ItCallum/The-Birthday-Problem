# The-Birthday-Problem
Here is some code that I have created to solve an assignment relating to the birthday problem.

The assigment had 3 main question in which this code aims to solve 

Part 1 
Simulates a random sample of 10 birthdays and then checks whether or not there is one or more shared birthday in the sample. 

Part 2
Estimate the probability of there being at least one shared birthday in a room of 10 people by simulating a large number of samples of 10 birthdays and computing the proportion
with at least one shared birthday

Part 3
Generalise the function from part 2 so that it can estimate the probability for rooms containing n people for any n. The code also needs to do N repertions of the experiment.
